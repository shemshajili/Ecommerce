                    <h2>The VogueVie Origin Story</h2>
                    <p>VogueVie`s  founder and creative director Meb Rure hails from an industrial design background. In 2015, Meb decided to change gears and turn her energy towards VogueVie, a collection of exceptional handbags. Focusing on quality material, good design, craftsmanship and sustainability, VogueVie reflects the epitome of quality over quantity.</p>
                    <p>Meb was highly inspired by the Bauhaus Movement's artists and architects. From Mies van der Rohe's works to Kandinsky's paintings, to Aalto's furniture, she acquired a rationalist vision of design by gleaning how they served a utilitarian purpose in a cleverly simple way. VogueVie merges industrial design and fashion, creating functional handbags made of luxurious and honest materials to improve people's lives in small but important ways.</p>
